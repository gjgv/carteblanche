High Priority
[X] 1 - Link Orders/Carts with the current_user
	Tutorial version currently links Orders with the 'session'. See Application_Controller and Order_Items Controller
	Because of this, whenever we close the window, we also close the session. Therefore the existing order associated with it loses its link, and we cannot use it again (but it still exists in the database)

	UPDATE: Now implemented as of 6:40PM

[ ] 2 - Limit the number of purchaseables with the 'stock' value of the Item
	Currently, we can buy an unlimited number of macarons

[ ] 3 - Add checkout process

Medium Priority
