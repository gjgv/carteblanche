High Priority
	[X] 1 - Fix the overcounting issue

		UPDATE: Now implemented as of Feb 1, 12:50AM by GS

	[X] 2 - Link Orders/Carts with the current_user
		Tutorial version currently links Orders with the 'session'. See Application_Controller and Order_Items Controller
		Because of this, whenever we close the window, we also close the session. Therefore the existing order associated with it loses its link, and we cannot use it again (but it still exists in the database)
